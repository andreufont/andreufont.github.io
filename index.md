## Research Interests

I study the Large Scale Structure of the universe using spectroscopic data, 
mainly from the <abbr title="Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey">BOSS</abbr> collaboration. 
In particular, I study the Lyman alpha forest and quasars as tracers of the density field.
Our measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) at high redshift provide 
very accurate constraints on the expansion history of the Universe. 
You can find a press release from 2014

and a more updated outreach article here.
