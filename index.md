My name is Andreu Font-Ribera, and staff scientitst at the
<a href="http://www.ifae.es/eng/">Institut de Física d'Altes Energies (IFAE)</a>, in my hometown of Barcelona.

For years my website said that it was under construction, with the hope that one day it would be amazing, but now I accept that it will most likely stay like this for a while.

## Brief CV

Before moving to IFAE, I was:
  * a PhD student at the Institut de Ciencies de l'Espai (Barcelona, 2007-2011)
  * a postdoc at the University of Zurich (Zurich, 2011-2013)
  * a postdoc at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley, 2013-2016)
  * a lecturer at University College London (London 2016-2020)

From 2016 to 2020 I was supported by a STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellowship (grant reference ST/N003853/1) and now I am supported by FSE funds trough the  program Ramon y Cajal (RYC-2018-025210) of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.


## Research Interests

Most of my research interests are in the area of observational cosmology.
I am particularly interested in the analysis of large spectroscopic datasets to study the large-scale structure of the Universe. 
In short, I construct 3D maps of the distribution of mass as a function of time, and I use these maps to understand better the evolution of the Universe.

During the last ten years I have been heavily involved in the cosmological analysis of the <a href="http://www.sdss3.org/surveys/boss.php/">Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)</a> collaboration, and of its successor 
<a href="https://www.sdss.org/surveys/eboss/">eBOSS</a>.
I was one of the main authors of the DR16 BAO results using the Lyman alpha forest dataset, presented in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08995">du Mas des Bourboux et al. (2020)</a>, and of the final cosmological analysis from SDSS, presented in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08991">eBOSS Collaboration et al. (2021)</a>. 

Our measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) at high redshift provide 
very accurate constraints on the expansion history of the Universe. 
You can find a press release from 2014 
<a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/news-releases/2014/04/07/boss-quasars-measure-expansion">here</a>, 
and outreach article  
<a href="http://www.earlyuniverse.org/the-universe-before-dark-energy/">here</a> (in English) 
and a more recent outreach article <a href="https://github.com/andreufont/andreufont.github.io/blob/master/eBOSS_IyC.pdf">here</a> (in Spanish, published in Investigación y Ciencia). 

I am now co-leading the BAO analysis from the Lyman alpha forest dataset of the 
<a href="http://desi.lbl.gov">Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)</a>.
Since May 2021, DESI is trying to solve the mistery of Dark Energy, while measuring the mass of the neutrinos, the lightest particles that exist.
