    My name is Andreu Font-Ribera, and I'm Rutherford Fellow at University College London. 

    I study the Large Scale Structure of the universe using spectroscopic data, mainly from the BOSS and eBOSS collaborations. In particular, I study the Lyman alpha forest and quasars as tracers of the density field. 
    
    Our measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) at high redshift provide very accurate constraints on the expansion history of the Universe.
