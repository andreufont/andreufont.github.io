    <p> My name is Andreu Font-Ribera, and I'm Rutherford Fellow at University College London. </p>

    <h2> Research Interests </h2>
    <p> I study the Large Scale Structure of the universe using spectroscopic data, 
      mainly from the BOSS and eBOSS collaborations. 
      In particular, I study the Lyman alpha forest and quasars as tracers of the density field.
      Our measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) at high redshift provide 
      very accurate constraints on the expansion history of the Universe. 
      You can find a press release from 2014 
      <a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/news-releases/2014/04/07/boss-quasars-measure-expansion">here</a> 
      and a more updated outreach article here. </p>
